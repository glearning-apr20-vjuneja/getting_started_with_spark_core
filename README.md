getting_started_with_spark_core
===============================

Personal projects that I plan to run using the spark core.

Would code for sensors including
1. DHT11 - Temperature & Humidity monitor
2. IR Receiver & Emittor - Cheap Ones
3. 20mm PhotoCell Resistors
4. HC-SR501 - Motion Sensor
5. MQ2 - Gas Sensor
6. Digital Battery Level Indicator

I would use git for posting all public libraries that I use for these sensors.
